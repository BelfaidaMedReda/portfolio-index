## List of Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Monte Carlo Ï€ Estimation & 7-Segment Display
> Approximates Ï€ using the Monte Carlo method and visualizes the results with a 7-segment display rendered as PPM images. The frames are then combined into an animated GIF to show the convergence of the estimate.

### ðŸ”¹ Polygon Inclusion Detection
> This project implements a point-in-polygon detection algorithm using the ray-casting method. It checks if a point lies inside or outside a polygon by counting the number of segment intersections with a ray starting from the point. An odd count means the point is inside, while an even count means it is outside.
